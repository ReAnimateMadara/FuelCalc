Mini Project for clg sem 5 -> DYPU

This was made by Hrishit J, Rahul Y, Abhishek P, Piyush P

This is a web application which so far uses HTML5 (jinja as well) and Python 3.11 (Flask for web connection). It uses a random forest regressor to calculate the price of airplane fuel in india's 4 major cities:

**
Mumbai
Delhi
Kolkata
Chennai
**

Fuel price data was taken from https://iocl.com/aviation-fuel
The fuel consumption data was simulated in X-Plane 11

In the calculation, it uses the Altitude, ZFW (Zero Fuel Weight of the acft), Flight plan distance as the 3 independant variables
The dependant variable is Fuel price
